2022.

I decided to head first and run the Dragon of Icespire Peak and Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak modules after doing two One-Shots and playing a part of it with my Wife - it didn't end well.  

Levels 1 to ~14.  
Everything avaible on DnD Beyond - maps, stat blocks, etc.,  

Wrote up the following and posted it on the Discord Server I had been playing on for the past few months.

Hey 👋 
I’m looking to take the plunge and run a module based campaign, 3-5 players.

Would be running from level 1 to ~14 using the following:
- Dragon of Icespire Peak 🏔️ 
- Storm Lords’s Wrath ⛈️ 
- Sleeping Dragon’s Wake 😴 
- Divine Contention ⛪️

Casual and fun but with some challenges e.g., Backstories not needed but using the Injury/Madness Tables, etc.,

With that I’d like to sprinkle 🤌 in some chaos with the use of Plot Points and also offer the Players the chance to run sessions - a chance to DM without commitment, only consequences 😈

🚫 Restrictions 
Any race and class with use of Tasha’s. Though you might get some funny looks.
🚫 Homebrew
Keep it simple.
🚫 PvP
Teamwork makes the dream work. Don’t be a 🍆.

Session 0 will be 21st July and rolling on then after on Thursdays 

```

Instantly caught a few peoples attention but interested died. 3 Players was enough to start with but I knew I needed more as it would take only one Player to miss a session and 33% of the Party was gone. Perseverance, got me two more bumps and now 7 potential Players. Great, I thought, once we had a Session Zero, some people might drop. It's only natural, yeah?  

I was totally wrong, I had 7 Players all eager to join me even though I stated a maximum of 5. I tried to be diplomatic in the video call with the Players and that if anyone wanted to drop that would be appreciated but otherwise I'd need to have a think of who I wanted in the Campaign.  
It was an awkward 5 minutes when people didn't speak or got the wrong idea. Eventually, two Players dropped - the most active in the conversations - and I was left with 5 Players who I didn't know of anything of, other than they wanted to play in my Campaign.  

I caught up with another DM afterwards to chat through it, and from what I recall, from their experience it was typical. It was a weird start but I had committed now. I got my Players and I now needed to give them a Campaign.  

Within 2 weeks, 1 Player dropped, they only played in the first session and missed the second. Down to 4, no problem, felt too awkward to ask those who dropped in Session Zero, so continued with the group as is. All was going well for a few months, Party were on their way to fight Cyrovain, then another dropped out. Down to 3 Players, right before the end of the first Module. Fuck.  

Definitely, I was at a point of finishing the campaign with the conclusion of the first book. Never did I think I'd be in such a situation given the amount of Player interested at the start. Never truly appreciated the level of commitment needed from a DM to continue when things are looking sour.  

Perseverance (again). Reached out to some close friends, blostered the numbers (5) and here we are; 2 books to go and determination to finish them.
