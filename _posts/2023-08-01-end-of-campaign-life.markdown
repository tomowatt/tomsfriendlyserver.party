So like all good things, it must come to an end.

My first DnD Campaign using Dragon of Icespire Peak and Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak came to the penultimate end with a huge fight in the town of Leilon - Undead, Dragons, Cultists and more.

Things didn't turn out as epic as I thought they would be due to a miscalculation of various spells being used e.g., Conjure Woodland Beings to turn the Party in Tyrannosaurus Rexs. But that's the fun of being on the other side of the table and having to deal with the unexpected.

But managed to bring out the [Zinogre](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/3657578-zinogre) - credit to [u/Amellwind ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amellwind/) - to juice things up with the Cult of Talos.

It was nearly a year to the date it started and I could have made it last a bit longer but it felt right to end it there. This was due to re-reading some of the end quests that were meant to be done in the Divine Contentions module and feeling they weren't appropriate at all, either not making sense to the story e.g., Dumathoinâ€™s Gulch which sends the Party to get an item which might never be used at all.

The "final" two quests didn't sit right with me either. As they assumed certain events would happen no matter what the Party did in the Leilon Beseiged and an end fight with somewhat weak end boss.

But now that's it's all over, I'm feeling lost but there is an itch to run a game again. I'm still a Player in a campaign but it doesn't quite cover the feelings of being a DM. Definitely, will run another soon but not sure which way to go: module based or homebrew.

Definitely want to test myself and give a fun and exciting game to my Players but also want to make sure I don't burn out or make something that's silly from the start. With that also looking for inspiration from the likes of Pathfinder, Starfinder and Cyberpunk Red for different styles of games, settings and rules to change things up for a more fun experience.

So watch this space?
